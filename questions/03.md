```sql

## Incorrect

```sql
CHANGE TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TEXT;
```

> It seems like this should be a command, but it's not quite right. One word needs
> to be replaced. Which is it?

## Incorrect

```sql
CHANGE TABLE table_name COLUMN column_name TEXT;
```

> This command has two problems: two of the commands are wrong. How can we fix
> them?

I don't know.
