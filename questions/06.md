# SQL: Database Basics

To add a column to an existing table, which command is used?

## Correct

```
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TEXT;
```

> Exactly! This will add a new column that stores text to the table.

## Incorrect

```
CHANGE TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TEXT;
```

> It seems like this should be a command, but it's not quite right. One word needs
> to be replaced. Which is it?

## Incorrect

```
CHANGE TABLE table_name COLUMN column_name TEXT;
```

> This command has two problems: two of the commands are wrong. How can we fix
> them?

## Incorrect

```
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TEXT
```

> So close. One little punctuation mark is missing. What is it and where does it
> go?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
